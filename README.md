# Spam-with-Python
     pip install pyautogui
Simple python code to spam people and annoy them...
Firstly, install pyautogui in your IDE by using the above command in your terminal.                                       
Secondly, edit the script file with whatever text you want to, like maybe a annoying movie sciript or something that doesn't make any sense but is surely annoying,
save the script file and run the code.                  
Change the tabs to the place where you want to spam, like instagram or whatsapp tab and select the text bar and you're good to go
:)
